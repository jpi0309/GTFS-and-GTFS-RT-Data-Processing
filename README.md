# GTFS & GPS Data Processing for Public Transport

## Overview
This project processes GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) and GPS data to analyze public transport efficiency. It includes segmentation of bus routes, real-time GPS data processing, and visualization tools to assess bus movement and delays.

The project is divided into two main components:
1. **GTFS Data Processing** - Constructs a structured transit network by processing bus stops, route shapes, and segmenting routes for efficient pathfinding.
2. **GPS Data Processing** - Matches real-time GPS data to the GTFS-based network to track vehicle positions, estimate arrival times, and analyze delays.

## Features
- Generates a grid-based segmentation of the transit network.
- Processes public transportation data, including bus stops, arrivals, and schedules.
- Constructs a graph-based representation of the transportation network for efficient routing.
- Implements a real-time GPS tracking system that estimates bus positions and delays.
- Provides an interactive visualization of routes and GPS-tracked vehicles.
- Allows integration of updated data to maintain an accurate transit model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook "GTFS processing.ipynb"
   jupyter notebook "gps processing algorithm.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage
- Open and execute the GTFS processing notebook to segment and preprocess transit data.
- Run the GPS processing notebook to estimate real-time bus positions and delays.
- The computed results are stored in the `results/` directory and can be visualized as an interactive map.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- folium
- matplotlib
- shapely
- joblib
- networkx (for potential route optimization)

Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- GTFS data for bus stops, trips, and route shapes.
- Real-time GPS records of bus positions and timestamps.
- Processed outputs stored as CSV and interactive HTML maps.

## Future Improvements
- Integrating real-time data streaming.
- Enhancing GPS tracking accuracy and delay estimation.
- Expanding the approach to other cities beyond Gda≈Ñsk.
